# [Wellness Center]

This project is inspired by a tutorial I followed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2NNxr3WPDo&ab_channel=EdRoh), which focuses on leveraging the power of

- **React Typescript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **React Anchor Link**
- **React-Form**
- **Framer Motion**

## Modifications and Personal Touches

While the foundational concepts and techniques were adopted from the tutorial, I've made some modifications to the original project to align with my personal preferences and creative vision. These changes not only reflect my personal style but also allowed me to experiment with the technologies involved, further enhancing my learning experience.

### Getting Started.
